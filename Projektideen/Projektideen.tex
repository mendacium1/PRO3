	\section*{Projektideen}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Security Audit of a Small Business or University System}: Conduct a thorough security audit of a small business's or your university's IT infrastructure. This could involve vulnerability scanning, assessing the effectiveness of existing security measures, and providing recommendations for improvements.\\
		\item \textbf{Cybersecurity Training Game or Application}: Develop an interactive game or application that teaches basic cybersecurity concepts to users, such as password security, safe browsing habits, and understanding of common cyber threats.\\
		\item \textbf{Incident Response Drill}: Plan and execute a simulated cybersecurity incident for your university's IT infrastructure, followed by a thorough incident response that includes identifying the breach, containing it, and recovering from it.
		
		\pagebreak
		
		\item \textbf{Homelab-Security-Infrastructure}:
		\subsection*{Goal}
		
		To build a scalable and secure home-lab environment that can onboard client systems (both Linux and Windows) and provide critical cybersecurity services like WAF and SIEM.\\
		
		\subsection*{Project Phases}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Planning and Design:}\\
			Define Objectives: Clearly outline what you want to achieve with each service (WAF, SIEM, etc.).
			Infrastructure Design: Plan the network architecture, including the placement of services, segmentation, and how clients will be onboarded.
			Tool Selection: Choose the appropriate tools and software (e.g., Splunk for SIEM, and a suitable WAF solution).
			\item \textbf{Setting Up the Infrastructure:}\\
			Hardware and Software Setup: Acquire necessary hardware and install required software. This may include virtualization solutions for creating different client environments.
			Network Configuration: Set up the network, ensuring proper segmentation and security measures are in place.
			\item \textbf{Service Implementation:}\\
			WAF Setup: Install and configure the WAF to protect web applications from common threats and attacks.
			SIEM Implementation: Deploy a SIEM solution like Splunk, configure it to collect logs from various sources, and set up dashboards for monitoring.
			\item \textbf{Onboarding Clients:}\\
			Client Preparation: Prepare Linux and Windows systems with necessary configurations for onboarding.
			Integration: Integrate these client systems into the home-lab, ensuring they are properly communicating with the WAF and SIEM services.
			\item \textbf{Testing and Optimization:}\\
			Functionality Testing: Test the services for basic functionality and performance.
			Security Testing: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and rectify security gaps.
			Optimization: Fine-tune the services based on the test results for optimal performance and security.
			\item \textbf{Documentation and Reporting:}\\
			System Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation of the setup, configurations, and procedures.
			Findings and Recommendations: Document the findings from testing and provide recommendations for improvements.
			\item \textbf{Presentation:}\\
			Final Presentation: Prepare a presentation detailing the projectâ€™s objectives, implementation, challenges, findings, and learning outcomes.
			\item \textbf{Considerations:}\\
			Scalability: Ensure the design allows for easy scaling and addition of more clients or services.
			Security: Maintain a strong focus on security best practices throughout the project.
			Budget and Resources: Be mindful of the budget and resources available for the project.
			\item \textbf{Learning Outcomes:}\\
			Hands-on experience with WAF and SIEM tools.
			Understanding of network configuration and client onboarding.
			Insight into the challenges and considerations of managing cybersecurity services in a network environment.\\
			This project would not only enhance your technical skills but also give you valuable insights into the operational aspects of cybersecurity services. It's a comprehensive way to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.\\
